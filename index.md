Welcome to the Swimmy Mineral Fish archives website! Here you can find almost every version of the Scratch game Swimmy Mineral Fish.
## What is this?
Swimmy Mineral Fish archives is a website that serves as an archive for almost every version of Swimmy Mineral Fish, a Scratch game made by a small group of Scratchers, called Emerald Fish Studios. This archive is unofficial, and community-driven, therefore we may not have every single version of the game archived, but if you do believe you have found a non-archived version, feel free to make an issue on the Github repo!
## Where can I find the versions?
this site is a work in progress ok?
